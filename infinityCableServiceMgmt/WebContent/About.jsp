<h2>Our History</h2>

<p>In the late 1940s, entrepreneurs using simple antennas and Army-surplus coaxial cable created the countrys first cable television systems and revolutionized the way Americans watched TV. More than 70 years later, Infinity (Infinity), the second largest cable provider, owns and manages advanced, well-clustered cable systems throughout the United States. Infinity offers cutting edge digital technology, a rich range of home entertainment and information choices for the whole family to enjoy, and superior service that demonstrates customer satisfaction is our number one priority.
